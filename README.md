# Decision-Making under Uncertainty
This repository is intended for the individual projects of the course '02435 - Decision-Making under Uncertainty' from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains all the data, scripts, literature, and reports for each assignment and exercises.

# Program
All assignments are coded in [Julia](https://www.julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). For the Julia code, I tried to follow Invenia's [Blue](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle) guidelines for code styling.

# Assignment 1
The first assignment was a mix between a brush-up on MILP modelling and Stochastic Programming. The assignment was divided in 5 tasks:
* Modelling a mixed-integer linear program
* Duality
* General questions on stochastic programming
* Modelling a two-stage stochastic program
* Evaluation of stochastic programs

The main results of the assignment was the use uncertainty into decision-making (and its evaluation) through two-stage stochastic programming.
